# 📊 Sales Analysis Case Study  
### Data Cleaning and Exploratory Analysis Using Python

---

## 📝 Executive Summary

This case study demonstrates how raw, inconsistent sales data was transformed into a reliable dataset through structured data-cleaning and exploratory analysis techniques.  
The project reflects a real-world business scenario where data quality directly affects reporting accuracy, financial integrity, and strategic decision-making.

## 🏢 Case Background

A retail organization collected sales data from multiple systems, resulting in issues such as:

- Missing transaction details  
- Duplicate records  
- Incorrect numeric formats  
- Inconsistent date fields  
- Irregular text entries  
- Outliers in quantities and amounts  

These issues created significant discrepancies in revenue reports and performance summaries.  
A complete data-cleaning workflow was required to produce accurate, analysis-ready data.

## 🎯 Business Questions

The project focuses on answering critical business questions:

1. What is the actual sales volume and revenue after correcting data-quality issues?  
2. Which products and regions generate the largest share of revenue?  
3. What monthly or seasonal patterns influence sales?  
4. Are any anomalies present in transaction amounts or quantities?  
5. Which customer or product segments consistently drive sales?

## ⚙️ Methodology

A structured, case-study-oriented approach was followed:

### 1. 🔍 Data Audit  
Identification of missing values, formatting problems, outliers, and inconsistent structures.

### 2. 🧹 Data Cleaning  
A comprehensive cleaning process including:

- Duplicate removal  
- Missing value treatment  
- Data-type corrections  
- Text standardization  
- Outlier detection and handling  
- Date normalization (month, year, quarter)  
- Logical validation of numeric fields  
- Creation of a final verified dataset  

### 3. 📈 Exploratory Analysis  
Post-cleaning analysis covered:

- Revenue distribution  
- Product performance patterns  
- Regional sales comparison  
- Customer behavior trends  
- Monthly and seasonal insights  

### 4. ✔️ Insight Validation  
Ensuring findings align with corrected, high-quality data.
